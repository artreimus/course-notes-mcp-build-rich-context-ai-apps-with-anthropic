# MCP Course Notes: Build Rich-Context AI Apps with Anthropic ðŸ“š

This repository contains the notebooks & code written while taking the [DeepLearning.AI short course](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/mcp-build-rich-context-ai-apps-with-anthropic/) on the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, created in partnership with **Anthropic**.

## ðŸŒŸ Why MCP?

Modern LLM apps often need to call external tools, search knowledge bases, or inject domain-specific prompts. MCP provides an **open, client-server standard** that makes those integrations consistent and reusable across projects and teams.
